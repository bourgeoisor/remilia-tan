# Remilia-tan

## Installation / Usage

I'll write a better readme someday.
To be able to test the bot locally, you should have nodejs and npm installed already.

Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/finiks/remilia-tan.git

Install the packages required for testing:

    cd remilia-tan
    npm install -g hubot coffee-script

If you want to launch the bot locally:

    bin/hubot --name remilia-tan

## ToDo list

- Nothing yet.
